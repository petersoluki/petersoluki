## 👋 Hi there, I'm a Mobile Engineer

I'm currently learning to build mobile apps with Flutter and Dart, creating sleek, scalable solutions for real-world users.
🔭 Always open to exploring new tools and technologies that solve real problems efficiently.
👯 I’m keen on collaborating on impactful Flutter projects and contributing to open source.
🌍 Solving big, global problems is exciting — but I believe the everyday challenges around us matter too. Sometimes, the small fixes make the biggest difference.
